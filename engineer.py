    # engineers are spawned with a number of tasks
    # they run models which will tell them what direction to head
    # their models are dependent on other users progress
    # if another user is generating bad information but is unaware of it, design will take longer to close
    # tasks have varying levels of priority
    # impact of bad decision on low priority task is small
    # each task has an associated model
